# BREASTFEEDING

## Breastfeeding has many advantages

**FOR THE BABY**

- During the first 6 months of life, the baby needs nothing more than breast milk — not water, not other milk, not cereals [anaj], not teas, not juices.
- Breast milk contains exactly the water and nutrients that a baby’s body needs. It is easily digested and efficiently used by the baby’s body. It helps protect against infections and allergies and helps the baby’s growth and development.

**FOR THE MOTHER**
- When the baby suckles, the uterus contracts. This helps reduce bleeding, but may be painful at first.
- Breastfeeding can help delay a new pregnancy [hamal].

**FOR THE FIRST 6 MONTHS OF LIFE, GIVE ONLY BREAST MILK TO YOUR BABY, DAY AND NIGHT 
AS OFTEN AND AS LONG AS SHE/HE WANTS**

## Suggestions for successful breastfeeding [doodh pilana]

- Immediately after birth, keep your baby in the bed with you, or within easy reach.
- Start breastfeeding [doodh pilana] within 1 hour of birth.
- The baby’s suckling stimulates your milk production. The more the baby feeds, the more milk you will produce.
- At each feeding, let the baby feed and release your breast, and then offer your second breast. At the next feeding, alternate and begin with the second breast.
- Give your baby the first milk (colostrum). It is nutritious and has antibodies to help keep your baby healthy.
- At night, let your baby sleep with you, within easy reach.
- While breastfeeding [doodh pilana], you should drink plenty of clean, safe water. You should eat more and healthier foods and rest when you can.

## The health worker can support you in starting and maintaining breastfeeding [doodh pilana]
- The health worker can help you to correctly position the baby and ensure she/he attaches to the breast. This will reduce breast problems for the mother.
- The health worker can show you how to express milk from your breast with your hands If you should need to leave the baby with another caretaker for short periods, you can leave your milk and it can be given to the baby in a cup.
- The health worker can put you in contact with a breastfeeding [doodh pilana] support group

** If you have any difficulties with breastfeeding [doodh pilana], see the health worker immediately**

## Breastfeeding and family planning
- During the first 6 months after birth, if you breastfeed exclusively, day and night, and your 
menstruation has not returned, you are protected against another pregnancy [hamal].
- If you do not meet these requirements, or if you wish to use another family planning method while 
breastfeeding [doodh pilana], discuss the different options available with the health worker
